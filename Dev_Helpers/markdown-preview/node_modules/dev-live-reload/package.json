Magic! :tophat: :sparkles: :rabbit2:\n\nInstalled by default on Atom windows running in dev mode. Use `cmd+shift+o` to\nopen a new dev mode window.\n\nUse `meta-shift-ctrl-r` to reload all core and package stylesheets.\n\nThis package is __experimental__, it does not handle the following:\n\n* File additions to a theme. New files will not be watched.\n\n![gif](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/69169/1387004/d2dc45f2-3b84-11e3-877e-cac8c51e9702.gif)\n",
